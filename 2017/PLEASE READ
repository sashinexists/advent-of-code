A note to all.

The contents of this folder does not represent my current coding ability.

When I did Advent of Code 2017 I was still learning javascript, I did not know how to use ES6 and hadn't read clean code.

If you would like to judge my current code (note: I'm still a beginner), check out the files in 2017.

This note was made on the 18th of May, 2018. If you are reading it in the future, it might actually be out of date.
